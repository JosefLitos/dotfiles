PS: Pick your fonts, I use nerd-fonts-inconsolata for more icons, but use different for normal text,
which is wasteful.

# Two dark themes I adopted

I made rofi and QT theme based on Material-Black-Lime. For icons I altered the color of
Material-Black-Lime-Suru-Glow and the other variant from Solarized-Dark-Green.
